# Overview
This is a project that shows how to connect an API endpoint that I created to actual javascript. I used firebase, node JS, as my tech stack.

# How to run it 
In your terminal in visual studio code, run firebase deploy --only functions and give it a couple seconds to execute.
You might have to go through all of your js files and in the bottom right change it from CRLF to LF, this is just the line ending sequence and GitHub changes it back to CRLF everytime I push it.
After running go to console.firebase.google.com go to your project that you created and go to functions. Here you should be able to see the requests over the last 24 hours. Furthermore, you can go
to postman create an account and test your actual API endpoints. You can do this by creating test data that you would like to put in there.
